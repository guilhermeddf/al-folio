Hey! My name is Guilherme, nice to meet you. I am a researcher and software developer with focus on Java. Currently, I am working in the electronic payments business, developing the most used API platform in Brazil for electronic payments by acquirers and facilitators. On the daily basis, I use Spring Boot as the main framework and knowledge in relational and non-relational databases, reactive and non-reactive data streams such as Kafka, development using an event-driven paradigm, and integrated and unitary testing framework. 

As a researcher, I am member of Collaborative and Automated Software Engineering [CASE](http://caseufrn.github.io/index){:target="\_blank"} Lab and Research Group at Digital Metropolis Institute [IMD](https://www.imd.ufrn.br/portal/){:target="\_blank"}.
In 2020 I finished my master's in Software Engineering at the Department of Informatics and Applied Mathematics [DIMAp](https://sigaa.ufrn.br/sigaa/public/departamento/portal.jsf?id=125){:target="\_blank"}. My advisor was Professor [Uirá Kulesza](http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/~uira/){:target="\_blank"}. In my research, I study the impact of continuous integration adoption on several software quality metrics.You can download my research [here](https://repositorio.ufrn.br/handle/123456789/31359).
My bachelor's degree (2017) was in Systems Information. I was advised by Professor [Dennis Sávio](https://sigaa.ufpi.br/sigaa/public/docente/portal.jsf?siape=1632028){:target="\_blank"}. We developed an agile project management tool integrated with GitHub and tested with software engineer students. You can download my research [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5c135dm81czuxh7/Sistemas_Guilherme%20Dutra.pdf?dl=0){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests are systems performance evaluation techniques and mining of software repositories with focus on several software quality metrics. I am currently researching the impact of continuous integration on code and design software quality metrics .
