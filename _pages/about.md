Hey! My name is Guilherme, nice to meet you. I am a MSc Student in Software Engineering at the Department of Informatics and Applied Mathematics [DIMAp](https://sigaa.ufrn.br/sigaa/public/departamento/portal.jsf?id=125){:target="\_blank"}. My advisor is Professor [Uirá Kulesza](http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/~uira/){:target="\_blank"}. I am a member of Collaborative and Automated Software Engineering [CASE](http://caseufrn.github.io/index){:target="\_blank"} Lab and Research Group at Digital Metropolis Institute [IMD](https://www.imd.ufrn.br/portal/){:target="\_blank"}.

My bachelor's degree (2017) was in Systems Information. I was advised by Professor [Dennis Sávio](https://sigaa.ufpi.br/sigaa/public/docente/portal.jsf?siape=1632028){:target="\_blank"}. We developed an agile project management tool integrated with GitHub. You can download my research [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5c135dm81czuxh7/Sistemas_Guilherme%20Dutra.pdf?dl=0){:target="\_blank"}.

As an intern, at the City Hall in Boa Viagem, Ceará in 2017, I was responsible for updating and managing the network infrastructure improving the quality of the data transfer service.

My research interests are systems performance evaluation techniques and mining of software repositories. I am currently researching technical debt management in collaboration with the [DataPrev](http://portal.dataprev.gov.br/){:target="\_blank"}, a technology company.
